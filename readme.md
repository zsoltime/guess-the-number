# Day 1 of My 3 Weeks Game Challenge

This is the first day of my [3 weeks challenge](https://github.com/zsoltime/game-challenge), bringing you a number guessing game.

In this HTML5 game you should guess a randomly selected integer in the shortest possible time with the fewest number of guesses.

## User Stories

- [ ] There are different levels and the game is getting more and more difficult by reaching higher levels
- [x] After my guess, the game shows if the secret number is higher or lower
- [x] There is a timer tracking the time
- [ ] I get a score based on the time and the number of guesses
- [x] I can see my all-time best score and time

## Next Steps

It was the easiest game so far (first one, lol); however, there are no levels available because I had no idea how to make it more difficult. One possible solution would have been to increment the max value of the random number, but people use "binary search" so it wouldn't really be more difficult.
